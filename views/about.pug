          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p My name is Kelby Nylander, I am a disabled veteran looking to start a new career as a web developer. My experiences in the military have shaped me to be a better person, coworker, and a great addition to any workplace. I have a number of skills that make me a particularly strong match for your organization. I have been a crew leader to fix multimillion dollar cargo air craft and worked with small teams to solve logistical and process problems for the U.S. Air Force. For my efforts I made Staff Sergeant in less than 4 years. I can't wait to show you how my work ethic and team skills will be a great addition in the field of web development!
